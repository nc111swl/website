								<p>During my freshman year of college, I took part in a semester-long design project, and for that project we were given the option of designing a building, creating a rover, or making a device for what was called the Rapid Assembly and Design (RAD) Challenge. The goal of RAD was to simulate a tech company, where we would prototype a design meant to be sold to a target audience, while also creating a project schedule, a cost estimate, and a Preliminary and Final Design Investigation. I was naturally drawn to RAD because of the degree of freedom it offered, and viewed it as a way to learn as much technical knowledge as possible (I did not have much engineering experience prior to this), as well as a very brief glimpse into what the engineering industry would actually be like.</p>
								<p>Initially, I proposed to make a pair of augmented reality glasses, but my professor pivoted me to instead designing a pair of glasses that assisted visually impaired individuals detect obstacles at eye-level (after all, if Google couldn’t get Google Glasses off the ground, it’d be ill advised to allow a first year student with little experience to try and make one in four months). My first task was first figuring out how to actually accomplish this. I played around with a few ideas, and settled on the final high level design: the glasses would use three ultrasonic sensors (one each for left, right, and forward), a Raspberry Pi Zero, and a pair of Bluetooth earbuds to indicate the direction and distance of obstacles via audio signals. A signal would play from the direction of the obstacle, and the volume of that signal would increase the closer the obstacle came. After this, it was time to get to work. </p>
								<p>I designed the frames of the glasses with Autodesk Fusion 360, a CAD software, and through the process learned very basic CAD skills. To manufacture them, I used 3D printing, since it allowed for relatively quick creation of relatively complex designs. This was very important, as the design underwent many, many changes throughout the process. This was my first engineering project, so I didn’t have experience or reference points for things as simple as dimensions (the first prototype was a flop because I made the temples, the parts that hook onto your ears, three millimeters wide), tolerancing (I had to make multiple prints through trial and error just to get the sensors to fit in the frames because I naively made the dimensions in the CAD exact), or realizing that wires actually need a place to go. However, I was exposed to some of the drawbacks of 3D printing when all the printers were either being used or broken a few days before the final prototype was due. Coincidentally, this was also around this time that I had my first experience using laser-cutting, and lo and behold, the final frames were made of wood rather than PLA. It wasn’t as pretty, but it got the job done.</p>
								<p>I also wrote the code for the project using Python, starting with the ultrasonic sensors. I programmed the sensors to detect objects within fifty centimeters and store the distance. I then learned how to program the Bluetooth earbuds, which included how to send and receive signals with a Bluetooth transmitter for the Raspberry Pi Zero, as well as writing a function which changed the volume depending on a numerical value. However, I could not for the life of me figure out how to play directional sound from the earbuds, which led to a brief foray into audio engineering (I used a free audio mixer to create different files for each direction, with the only difference being the earbud the sound played from). I then used my understanding of the basic syntax of Python to stitch these parts together: the ultrasonic sensors would detect an object and record the distance; then, depending on which sensor the signal came from and the distance, the Pi would send the appropriate audio file and volume to the earbuds, which would then inform the direction and distance to the user. Of course, in tandem with the code is the electronics. I initially used a breadboard to test the ultrasonic sensors with the Raspberry Pi, which eventually shifted to soldering permanent connections so that the components could fit within the frames, and through this process I learned basic circuitry skills and soldering.</p>
								<p>Throughout the project, there were also deliverables that had to be completed. I was responsible for creating documents such as a Preliminary Design Report, which was an initial overview on the goals of the project, the problems it would be solving, and the design and approach of the project, as well as a Final Design Report, which reiterated the goals of the project, communicated the actual approach the design took to accomplish those goals, and included CAD drawings, circuit diagrams, and code. I was also responsible for giving Milestone Presentations to report our progress, and at the end of the semester I gave a final presentation where the goal was to sell our prototype to a board of professors and TAs, which was my first exposure to giving technical presentations, and where I found that I actually quite enjoy doing them.</p>
								<p>By the end of the project, I had created a fully functional prototype which was able to inform the wearer the distance and direction of eye-level obstacles. I had learned the basics of CAD, coding, and circuitry, and gained experience using 3D printers and laser cutting. I also learned that I enjoy projects with open ended problems that allow for a great degree of freedom to innovate. My hard work wasn’t all for nothing, either; I was invited to present at Tandon’s RAD Showcase, which highlighted innovative and technically impressive RAD projects. Overall, it was a very eye-opening experience where I learned a lot, and I look back on it fondly.</p>
