								<p>I spent my second year of college as a Mechanical Technical Lead in NYU’s Robotics Design Team (RDT). During my first year, I had learned the skills I would need to succeed, and I went into my second year hungry to apply those skills along with lessons learned. RDT participates in the NASA Lunabotics Competition, a national competition where teams have nine months to design and manufacture a robot, after they compete at the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
								<p>This year NASA changed the objectives of the competition. Previously, robots had to excavate through sandy regolith and collect gravel from underneath it, but this year the goal was just to collect as much of the sandy regolith as possible and place it in the construction zone to make a berm. This was a drastic change, and my fellow mechanical leads and I got to work designing a robot that met these new requirements.</p>
								<p>Our guiding principle was to create a robot that would collect large amounts of regolith in one go, rather than collecting small amounts and making multiple trips. This  made autonomy easier and saved power and time, for the tradeoff of being heavier and larger. To that end, our initial design was as follows:</p>
								<p>For the excavation system, we would use a shovel attached to a conveyor belt. The shovel would skim regolith off the surface and funnel it up to the conveyor belt, which would then transport it to a deposition bin inside the robot. The entire system would be connected via a pivot point, being folded inside the robot for transportation and then rotating outwards when it was time to dig.</p>
								<p>The deposition bin’s purpose was to hold the regolith and dump it back onto the conveyor belt to deposit it in the construction zone. It was attached to the same pivot point as the excavation system to minimize the distance between them and used linear actuators to rotate it upwards to get the regolith back onto the conveyor belt. The linear actuators were on a scissor lift system to achieve a maximum height that was nearly twice that of just the linear actuators alone.</p>
								<p>The design of the wheels was reminiscent of a bicycle wheel, with spokes in the center that supported an outer ring that bore the majority of the weight, with cleats to help with traction. We used an open wheel design because last year our wheels were enclosed with polycarbonate sheets, which had a few disadvantages. Regolith would collect on the inside of the wheel, decreasing the maneuverability of the robot and more importantly causing the polycarbonate to crack, decreasing the structural stability of the entire wheel.</p>
								<p>While working on the initial design, we also trained the new members. I was responsible for hosting the CAD training (which I was informed of on quite a short notice since the lead who was supposed to host them suddenly left the team). Now, could I have just recycled the old training? Yes. Did I? Nope. If I was going to do the training, I was going to have a little fun with it. So, I decided to have all them recreate the characters from the video game Among Us without telling them.The training itself lasted multiple sessions and consisted of me walking them through the different tools available on our CAD software of choice, Onshape, and then having them practice by creating individual parts of the Among Us character. A few of them eventually caught on, but seeing their reactions when it all came together was priceless.</p>
								<p>At the end of this preliminary design phase, we had trained all the new members and created a rough design of a robot. The technical leads and I made an initial CAD, designated the amount of space allocated to each system, and divvied up who would be working on creating the detailed design of each one. I wanted a challenge and to learn as much as I could, so I chose to lead the team that would work on the excavation system. RDT had never used a conveyor belt or shovel as its excavation, so I had to work from the ground up. That, in addition to the fact that this was the first time I had held a leadership position in a technical setting, meant that it was going to be an uphill battle. With our members trained and the initial design created, it was time for us to get to work.</p>
								<p>To say the detailed design portion of the year was difficult would be an understatement. I spent many long nights researching how conveyor belts function, working on the CAD, and making sure every detail was accounted for. I learned about timing belts, from how to calculate the desired length to the definition of belt pitch, gear to torque ratios so we could achieve the desired torque, and how to create gears that would mesh correctly with our belt. I also learned things like advanced CAD skills, how to coordinate with the electrical and software teams, and how to make sure my design would work with the other mechanical systems. Partway through the detailed design phase, the software team told us that we wouldn’t be able to move while digging, so we had to rely solely on the conveyor belt to dig which added a lot to the workload as well. The main reason this portion of the project was so difficult, however, was a mistake that we made in leadership.</p>
								<p>At this point, we still didn’t fully trust our members to do work correctly. We viewed them as too inexperienced and couldn't be relied on to work on the actual robot. So, we stuck them on menial tasks like remaking the CAD of the previous year’s robot while we did almost all the work on the current robot. This stance was mostly held by technical leads from the previous year, and since I was still new, I went along with it. As a result, we weren’t being leads; we were just doing the member’s work ourselves.</p>
								<p>Eventually, I realized that it simply wasn’t sustainable. I asked around, both with technical leads of other competencies, as well as our alumni advisors, to see how they ran their ships, and I eventually settled on the following. When our mechanical engineering advisor was a lead, he held work sessions with his members where the members would work in person while he guided and mentored them. The sessions were long, but members weren’t expected to do any work outside of them. This would be a large departure from how we ran things, as we would just check in on our member’s progress, tell them what part of the old robot to recreate next, and then send them on their merry way, but it was a change that we needed. I discussed implementing this change with the other mechanical leads and there was some pushback, but I sincerely believed that it would be beneficial, so I went on to implement it.</p>
								<p>First I let the members in my excavation team know the new way that we would work and figured out a three hour stretch where they were free, which ended up being Mondays and Wednesdays from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM (which raised some eyebrows when I told my friends). The next thing was to break down goals and make them into actionable tasks. I’d already been doing this in my head, but this was the first time I’d actually put it down in writing, so it was still a learning experience. Then, it was time to hold the meetings. The beginning of meetings were spent making announcements pertinent to the team, delegating tasks, after which the members would take ones that they wanted to do, and checking in on progress. They spent the rest of the meetings working, while I would hover around to check in and give them help when needed. My role shifted to a managerial one, involving checking up on progress, delegating tasks, helping members, and communicating with the other mechanical leads as well as the electrical and software teams. I also learned advanced technical skills such as finite element analysis by running simulations on the parts my members designed. Also, to clarify, I was learning with my members, since it was my first time working on a conveyor belt system too; I just happened to be more experienced with design, CAD, and manufacturing.</p>
								<p>It was a big change, the meetings were long, and the work challenging. But boy, am I glad I did it. I got to know each and every one of my members, where before they were just names in a Slack channel. I was also able to be a better mentor by learning why they were interested in mechanical engineering and RDT, what motivated them, their strengths and their weaknesses. Additionally, it was extremely satisfying and rewarding to see the room come alive after they got to work; to see the buzz of brainstorming, the members working together to overcome problems, and the robot coming together. We would also always get pizza, so that was also a plus.</p>
								<p>The meetings were also successful in creating a working excavation system. Who would’ve thought that multiple people would be able to do more work than I, a single person, would ever be able to? My team was able to create a prototype shovel to see the minimum angle it could make with the ground (before being informed that it wouldn’t be compatible with software’s design), and we were also able to create a prototype conveyor belt from an older one that had been used in a previous year’s deposition system, all in the span of a month. This all culminated in a conveyor belt that was able to excavate sand from the local beach used for testing.</p>
								<p>The final design was the result of many people’s hard work and is shown below. It utilizes a timing belt with 3D printed gears attached to aluminum panels, which serves to provide both structural support and dustproofing to safeguard against regolith from getting into the internals and gumming up the gears. It was powered by an internal motor with a 3D printed case for further dustproofing, and excavated using 3D printed shovels screwed onto the timing belt. It was mounted on the chassis on a pivot point, and the connection point was offset from the end of the system and the centerline in order to minimize the distance from the deposition bin while providing the largest amount of clearance.</p>
								<p>Overall, my team’s design of the excavation system was successful. I learned advanced CAD skills and FEA, and leadership skills such as delegating work, motivating members, and learning to play to each individual’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as how to break down system level goals into smaller action items. Additionally, I also learned that I enjoy leadership roles and responsibilities, as well as being a mentor. I also gained more experience with working with other teams, and also learned to trust myself in figuring out new things and taking my own initiative, both by going into uncharted territory in making the conveyor belt, and also going through with the new meeting structure (which the other mechanical leads also ended up adopting). I’m happy to say that my team and I did our part in creating a successful robot, which would win first place for the most innovative student-led project in the NYU Tandon Research Expo and perform well at the Lunabotics Competition.</p>
								<p>Below you can find the Proof-of-Life video we sent to NASA, successfully demonstrating full functionality of the robot and all of its subsystems.</p>
								<p>Following this, you can also see our run at the Lunabotics Competition itself. Unfortunately, during shipping, many of the shovels broke off, but we were still able to collect 10,000 cubic centimeters, which was the first time in RDT history that we collected a significant amount of material! My year in RDT was extremely rewarding and enjoyable, and I’m coming back this year as a Team Lead, ready to make this year even more successful.</p>
