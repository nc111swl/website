								<p>When I started NYU Tandon, I knew that I wanted to join a technical extracurricular project. I didn’t have much experience, so I wanted one that would be a challenge. After doing a bit of research, I found that NYU provides Vertically Integrated Projects (VIPs), where students from all years and disciplines come together to work on year-long projects. Of these VIPs, one in particular caught my attention: The NYU Robotic Design Team (RDT). It is a VIP which participates in the NASA Lunabotics Challenge, where NASA invites collegiate teams from across the country to create a rover capable of navigating a simulated Lunar surface, dig through fifty centimeters of sandy lunar regolith, and collect and deposit as much subterranean gravelly regolith into the construction zone in a predetermined time, with an emphasis on autonomy. Teams are given nine months to design, manufacture, and test their robot, after which selected teams are invited to compete at the Kennedy Space Center. This is no easy task, as many teams fail to deposit any gravel at all. NASA provides very broad guidelines, giving teams a great degree of freedom in the physical execution of their robot, and RDT specifically focuses on creating new and innovative designs every year. All this, in addition to the fact that it offered the opportunity to work alongside other engineering disciplines such as software and electrical engineering, made this a very appealing VIP for me.</p>
								<p>I applied to be a mechanical engineer during the fall semester of my freshman year and made it in. I was trained to do CAD on Onshape, the software which the team uses, and manufacturing work, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and water jetting. At this point in the process, most of the high level designing was still being done by the Mechanical Leads, with us members being given tasks that would bring that design to life. This included putting screws in the CAD, creating connections for parts in the robot’s chassis, and 3D printing components in the NYU Makerspace. This semester provided me with the groundwork and foundational skills needed for CAD and manufacturing, but because I was both inexperienced and also preoccupied with my semester-long design project, I had not yet been able to participate in actually creating my own part in the robot.</p>
								<p>This all changed in the spring semester of my first year, however. I was given the opportunity to design the deposition bin of the robot, an opportunity that I jumped at. To give some background: our robot used a digging drum mechanism to dig through the sandy regolith and excavate the gravelly regolith. The drum had shovels attached on the outside, which would rotate around it and excavate material on the bottom and deposit it from the top into the deposition bin, which would sit at the center. The robot both excavates and deposits material by pivoting the whole assembly, arcing downard to excavate, and then depositing the material into the construction zone by pivoting the whole digging drum assembly up and over the robot. All of this would be ideally completed autonomously. My task was as follows: create a deposition bin that would filter out the sandy regolith while retaining the gravelly regolith, design it so that it would not lose material both while it was digging down, as well as before the pivot arm completed its arc to ensure all material would be deposited in the construction zone, and to incorporate sensors so that the robot would be able to detect the amount of material within the bin.</p>
								<p>Figuring out how to filter out the sandy regolith was pretty simple. NASA provided us the dimensions of the gravelly regolith, so after that it was just a matter of finding perforated aluminum sheets with holes that were less than those dimensions. That was what the main body of the bin was made out of, with individual panels being cut out using a water jet, and it was held together using 3D printed connectors and screws. Incorporating the sensors was also a relatively simple matter. The electrical team decided to use load cells to measure the weight, so using CAD models of those cells as reference, I designed 3D printed mounts that could be secured to the floor of the bin and gave space to run the necessary wiring up and out of the bin.</p>
								<p>The most interesting challenge when it came to designing the deposition bin was ensuring that the bin would catch all the material while it was digging down and that material wouldn’t start falling out before the arm completed its arc to deposit. The core of the issue is that the deposition bin is fixed to the inside of the drum. When digging downward, the opening of the bin would arc along with the bin, which means as the drum digs lower, it might reach a point where material misses the opening. When depositing, the drum might reach a point in the arc where the opening of the bin starts allowing material to fall through, but before it clears the frame of the robot, resulting in a loss in material.</p>
								<p>My initial solution to this was creating a mechanism within the drum that allowed the bin to rotate freely, relying on its center of gravity to keep it oriented upright. The bin would be connected to a series of ball bearings on aluminum shafts, which would then ride 3D printed tracks secured to the frame of the digging drum. By fastening the bearings to the bin in a specific orientation, and limiting the amount of space the bearings can travel on the tracks, the design resulted in the bin being oriented upright at the very bottom of the digging drum’s arc ensuring all material would be collected, and the bin not being fully tipped over until the pivot arm reached the maximum range of the arc, ensuring nothing fell out before that.</p>
								<p>My second solution to this problem was simpler, and made at the behest of my lead. We had started to plan for testing, and there was no guarantee that the bearings and shafts would make it on time. As such, my second solution was to alter the geometry of the bin. I expanded the side of the opening that was in the shovel’s direction of rotation to ensure it would catch all the material, while angling the opposite side inward to retain as much material as possible before the arm reached the final point of its deposition arc. Additionally, because the bearings had not arrived yet, I changed the fixed position of the bin so that it would only be oriented upright at the bottom of its arc to further ensure collection of the material. It was a good thing, too, that I made this second solution, because unfortunately, the bearings did not make it in time, so it was this simpler design which ended up going to competition.</p>
								<p>There were, however, hiccups during the design process. This was the first time that I had worked on a project of this scale, and designing a system within a larger whole was certainly a learning experience; things like ensuring that my design didn’t interfere with existing parts and figuring out how to connect it to the bigger system simply hadn’t occurred to me before. This was also the first time that I had made something complex meant to be manufactured, as the only prior experience I had similar to this was working on my Better Vision Glasses, where I only needed to make a simple frame for glasses that held electrical components. It was in RDT where I first learned that when you design a part, you actually have to make it so that you can build it in the real world (and I learned this quickly; making a design where you physically cannot fit a screwdriver in to fasten a screw does that to a person), and that ease of manufacturing matters a lot when it comes to creating a design.</p>
								<p>Overall, my design of the deposition bin was successful and completed its task, and I expanded on my CAD and manufacturing skills, learned the importance of making a design manufacturable, and gained experience in working on a subsystem within a complex project. All together, I’m happy to say that I did my small part in our creation of a successful robot, which won second place for the most innovative student-led project in the NYU Tandon Research Expo, to the point where Andrew Hamilton, the Dean of NYU, came to the team to learn more about it.</p>
								<p>Below you can find the Proof-of-Life video we sent to NASA, successfully demonstrating full functionality of the robot and all of its subsystems.</p>
								<p>We also performed decently well at the competition. The wireless communication team unfortunately could not make contact with the robot for the first half of our run, but the software team got it going by the second half, and we were able to deposit the first few rocks in the history of RDT! I greatly enjoyed my experience in RDT, and I came back the following year as a Mechanical Technical Lead, with more experience, lessons learned, and a fire to do even better.</p>
